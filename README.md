# Iteration 1

Summary of Iteration 1:

    As college students we want to create an app that provides a selection of delicious recipes.
    When I choose a recipe it will first show ingredients to make enough servings for one person,
    but I will be able to change the amount of servings I want. The number of servings selected must
    be a positive integer under 24. When I input the desired number of servings the measurements for
    the ingredients will change accordingly. The ingredient measurements will be shown in the
    simplest form of imperial volumetric units.

# Iteration 2

Summary of Iteration 2:
    
    In our app, users will be able to veiw a specific recipe from a provided list of recipes. When
    users select the recipe of their choice, our app should display the recipe's name, a description,
    a list of ingredients at their default serving size, and lastly a specific list of directions. Once 
    you have your chosen recipe, you should be able to change the amount of servings desired to a positive
    integer. The ingredients should scale to reflect the updated serving size. Our app will also have the 
    ability to add or remove recipes of the users choice. When adding a recipe the app will prompt the user 
    to enter the recipes name, ingredients, and directions. When removing a recipe it should no longer be 
    available in the list. Only added recipes can be deleted, the recipes preloaded in the app cannot be deleted.

# Specific Rules
1. The desired number of servings must be a positive integer.
2. All measurements must be in imperial volumetric units.
