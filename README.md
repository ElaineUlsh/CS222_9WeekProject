# Iteration 1

Recap of Iteration 1:

    To shortly recap Iteration 1, We as college students want to create an app that allows users to 
    veiw and choose a recipe from a gien list. Once the user has chosen a recipe, it will appear with the name 
    of the recipe, a list of ingredients at the default number of servings, with the ability for the user to enter
    their desired number of servings as long as it is a positive integer. The ingredient measurments will convert 
    to reflect the desired number of servings and it will appear in simplest volumetric imperial form.

# Iteration 2

Recap of Iteration 2:
    
    In our app, users will be able to veiw a specific recipe from a provided list of recipes. When
    users select the recipe of their choice, our app should display the recipe's name, a description,
    a list of ingredients at their default serving size, and lastly a specific list of directions. Once 
    you have your chosen recipe, you should be able to change the amount of servings desired to a positive
    integer. The ingredients should scale to reflect the updated serving size. Our app will also have the 
    ability to add or remove recipes of the users choice. When adding a recipe the app will prompt the user 
    to enter the recipes name, ingredients, and directions. When removing a recipe it should no longer be 
    available in the list. Only added recipes can be deleted, the recipes preloaded in the app cannot be deleted.

# Iteration 3:

Summary of Iteration 3:

    When a user inputs a recipe of their choice, our app will automatically save the information. So it can 
    be retreived, used, added or deleted. Even after the app has been rebooted. Our app will also show all ingredient measurments in 
    imperial volumetric fraction form. The measurments will be rounded to the most logical unit of measurement.


# Specific Rules
1. The desired number of servings must be a positive integer, user must press Enter after inputting desired servings.
2. All measurements must be in imperial volumetric units.
