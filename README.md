# Iteration 1

Summary of Iteration 1:

    As college students we want to create an app that provides a selection of delicious recipes.
    When I choose a recipe it will first show ingredients to make enough servings for one person,
    but I will be able to change the amount of servings I want. The number of servings selected must
    be a positive integer under 24. When I input the desired number of servings the measurements for
    the ingredients will change accordingly. The ingredient measurements will be shown in the
    simplest form of imperial volumetric units.

# Iteration 2

Summary of Iteration 2:

    In our app it will be very simple and easy to add or remove recipes. When adding a recipe you
    will have the ability to specify how many servings it makes and the ingredients in imperial
    volumetric units. Once my recipe is added, it will automatically scale down to one serving. 

# Iteration 3

Summary of Iteration 3:

    Our app will also have a "search" function that breaks recipes down into smaller categories or
    tags. Each recipe can be added to 5 tags chosen from a list that is provided when adding the
    recipe. I can also easily add or remove tags when editing the recipe.


# Specific Rules
1. The desired number of servings must be a positive integer below 24.
2. All measurements must be in imperial volumetric units.
